UPSILoN (AUtomated Classification of Periodic Variable Stars using MachIne LearNing)
aims to classify periodic variable stars such as Delta Scuti stars,
RR Lyraes, Cepheids, Type II Cepheids, eclipsing binaries, and
long-period variables (i.e. superclasses), and their subclasses
(e.g. RR Lyrae ab, c, d, and e types) using
well-sampled optical-band light curves regardless of
survey-specific characteristics such as color, magnitude, sampling rate,
etc (Kim+ 2015 in preparation).
